# raspberry pi as bluetooth speaker - headless paring

- follow this guide to setup your linux as A2DP Sink (Loudspeaker)
http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/47708/setup-raspberry-pi-3-as-bluetooth-speaker
- make sure the following is installed?  mpg321
- use 'bt-autopair.py' for headless automatic bluetooth pairing

## caveat
- pulseaudio has prooven to be quite unstable when alternaing inputsources, hence i restart it like all the times.
- pairing is being removed after disconnect: as pairing takes time, this time is used for restarting pulseadio
